"""Public URLs.

A guide is always /parts/<group-slug>/ regardless of category, and a category
listing is always /categories/<slug>/ -- /c/<slug>/ is kept as a short alias,
redirecting to the canonical path rather than duplicating the view.

The trailing <slug:token>/ pattern exists for the printed cards, which predate
this scheme and carry bare URLs like ioref.org/resistor and ioref.org/0496 --
a group slug and a part number, with no prefix at all. It must be last: it
matches any single path segment, so anything above it (search/, part-sets/,
parts/<slug>/, categories/<slug>/, c/<slug>/) has to get first refusal or the
resolver would swallow every one of them. See views.resolve_legacy.
