    """Authenticate a user asserted by an upstream SSO proxy.

    Used with AUTH_MODE=shib, where mod_shib terminates SAML and passes the
    resolved identity down as request headers.

    SECURITY: this backend trusts its input completely. It is only safe when the
    proxy in front of the app unconditionally *overwrites* these headers on every
    request, including requests where the client supplied them. If the app is
    reachable other than through that proxy, anyone can authenticate as anyone by
    setting a header. See accounts/middleware.py and deploy/apache/ for the
    corresponding proxy configuration.

    Users are provisioned on first sight with no groups, which in Wagtail means
    no `wagtailadmin.access_admin` and therefore no admin at all. Shibboleth
    asserts *who* someone is; it does not assert that they may publish pages.
    Putting somebody in Editors or Moderators stays a manual act in the Wagtail
    user interface, which is the point of provisioning them here: an admin can
    only grant rights to an account that exists, and this is what makes it exist
    without anyone typing an eppn by hand.
