class HeaderAuthenticationMiddleware:
    """Log a user in from SSO headers set by an upstream proxy.

    Modelled on Django's RemoteUserMiddleware but with configurable header names,
    since sites differ on whether the identity arrives as REMOTE_USER, eppn, or a
    site-specific attribute. Kept deliberately identical to ioref-inventory's
    copy: the two applications sit behind the same service provider and must
    agree on which attributes they read.

    Two behaviours worth knowing about:

    1. If the header is absent on a request but a header-authenticated session
       exists, the session is torn down. Otherwise a Shibboleth logout would
       leave the Django session alive and the user still signed in here.

    2. The session is re-established from headers on *every* request, so calling
       django.contrib.auth.logout() on its own achieves nothing: the next
       request signs the same person straight back in. Signing out must end the
       SAML session too; see accounts/views.py.

    The guides themselves are public, and Apache is configured with
    `requireSession 0` at the site root, so most requests arrive with no headers
    at all and fall through untouched.
