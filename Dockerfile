# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

# Follows ioref-inventory's Dockerfile, minus everything to do with a database.
# The previous file here was the stock Wagtail scaffold and had never been run:
# it installed from a requirements.txt this project does not have, on Python
# 3.12 against a project that requires 3.13, and ran `migrate` at startup.

# Pinned, and given its own stage rather than an inline `COPY --from=ghcr.io/...`:
# Dependabot's docker ecosystem reads FROM lines, so this is what makes the uv
# version something it can raise a pull request against.
